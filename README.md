### Justin Stewart
### Mini Project 3

## Description
This is a project based around flask/templates/blueprints and routes. This is very similar to the flask tutorial (in acknowledgement section) with a couple of minor changes. This program will allow a user to log in, create a blog post, modify the post, and register for the website. It uses a backend SQL database.

### Pip Install Instructions/Dependencies

* Please run the following to install all the packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* To initialize the database run the following:
```
flask --app flaskr init-db
```

### Executing program

* In a terminal window, please type the following:
```
flask --app flaskr run
```

### Output
By default, when running, this program will output a link to navigate the user to a html environment:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
